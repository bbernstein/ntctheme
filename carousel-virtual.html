            Great job on <b>War of the Worlds</b>! Loved it! Thanks for entertaining us during this time of isolation.
        </li>
        <li class="ntc-slide">
            Brava!!! Scared the hell out of me. What a great production and the sound effects. Wow!

        <li class="ntc-slide">
            <b>Sorry, Wrong Number</b> was riveting!
        </li>
        <li class="ntc-slide">
            We loved <b>Rebecca</b>! Thank you so much for helping us feel like we have 'date night' during the
            quarantine!

            Great fun once again. What an excellent troupe you have! And I really enjoyed the introductory jazz.

            I'm so impressed with how you did it. Hard to believe I was sitting in my backyard with my iPad because I
            could have sworn I was at the theatre. Only wish you could hear the applause throughout Newton. Bravo
            everyone and thank you!

            <b>Under Milkwood</b> was a wonderful performance and everyone outdid themselves. So lyrical and poetic!

        <li class="ntc-slide">
            I was blown away. An excellent, powerful and thought-provoking play, and very timely. Your new season has
            started off with a bang.

        <li class="ntc-slide">
            I thought the cast did an amazing job. At times I forgot that the actors were all in different windows. The
            skill to act, portray emotion without being able to physically move was impressive. I look forward to your
            next production.

            My husband and I loved <b>Rebecca</b>! Everything flowed so seamlessly, the sound effects worked so well, and
            the
            acting was amazing - you would think you had been doing online performances like this for years.
        </li>
        <li class="ntc-slide">
            I was amazed how the cast conveyed their character's personality with just their faces, hands, hairstyles
            and a few props. It was an ambitious undertaking - theatrically and technically - and I look forward to
            more.
        </li>
        <li class="ntc-slide">
            A big THANK YOU to the company for providing joy in crazy times! I've been so impressed by your creativity!
            Looking forward to your next production, and to the time we can meet in person!
        </li>
        <li class="ntc-slide">
            That was pure magic! Thank you!
