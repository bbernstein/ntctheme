            First of all, <b>Saint Joan</b> was a terrific choice of plays, secondly a terrific idea to have an all-women
            cast, and third what a terrific cast! Everyone shined in her role and Regan Sims as Joan was magnificent. I
            don’t believe any of Shaw’s plays have ever made me feel emotional but this one did in the hands of these
            terrific actors and obviously terrific director! Brava brava bravissima to you all!

            <b>Iphigenia Among the Taurians</b> was truly outstanding. Parts were very moving and the moments of humor
            effectively relieved the tension. The Chorus was magnificent. Well done!

            <b>Our Tears are the Same Color</b> was incredible. Extremely moving, extremely well directed, well acted. My wife
            and I were blown away.

            <b>Twilight</b> was beautiful, Regan is a powerhouse, and the one-person format was such a simple way to keep
            things interesting and unpredictable and show off Regan's versatility as a performer.

            I can't say enough good things about <b>Mary Stuart</b>. After the show ended, there was a collective 'Wow' gasp
            by everyone in the seats around us. The acting is fantastic, the lyric qualities of the play are inspiring,
            and the singing and music is amazing.

            Thank you for your wonderful work! To see <b>Mary Stuart</b> outside at night was truly very special. I look
            forward to many more performances.
