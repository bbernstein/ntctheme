        <li class="slide">“Thank you for making the theatre program such a success! This is not an easy feat in the age of COVID, but you managed it perfectly. My daughter has absolutely loved your program.”</li>
        <li class="slide">“Our daughter was tentative and unsure when we dropped her off at her first rehearsal and now it is one of her favorite activities. Melissa creates an inclusive, supportive environment where every child leaves feeling more confident.”</li>
        <li class="slide">“Thank you for creating a space where my son feels safe to take risks. He looks forward to being a part of the Newton Theatre Kids community and cast each week.”</li>
        <li class="slide">“My time at NTK not only sparked my interest in theatre, but it is where I explored much of my own voice. I felt myself gaining confidence, creativity, and friendship. It was truly my home throughout elementary school, something I looked forward to every week, and something I look back on now very fondly. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to work closely with you and hopefully provide for the next generation some of that same joy I experienced.”</li>
        <li class="slide">“My daughter has LOVED being part of NTK so far! When I collect her on a Tuesday evening she is always so full of joy and energy. She is loving the group and the music and the environment. You are clearly doing a wonderful, wonderful job of inspiring and nurturing these lovely kids.”</li>
        <li class="slide">“Our daughter had a terrific time. She enjoyed learning what it takes to put on a successful production. Her favorite aspect was the singing and dancing. More than this, she made some new friends.”</li>
        <li class="slide">“My daughters have had amazing experiences with Melissa and her wonderful team. Highly recommend! Am bummed my kids are aging out.”</li>
        <li class="slide">“This is a really wonderful program whether in-person or virtual. My 9- and 12-year-old daughters have both enjoyed and benefitted immensely from this program. They strike a really nice balance between a low-key, low-pressure environment while teaching professional acting and singing skills. Highly recommend!”</li>
        <li class="slide">“You are amazing! Thank you so much for doing this class. I really appreciate the enthusiasm, caring, and patience that you showed our kids. I really hope to keep my child engaged in theatre. I am so thankful her first taste was through your organization and with you in particular.”</li>
